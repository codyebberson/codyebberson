### Hail, well met ðŸ‘‹

I work on [Medplum](https://github.com/medplum/medplum), an open source healthcare data platform.  Healthcare tech startups use Medplum to launch quickly, securely, and compliantly.  It's built with TypeScript, Node, Express, and React.  If you're interested in healthcare tech, please feel free to reach out.

I enjoy participating in [js13kgames Competition](https://js13kgames.com/) - an annual competition for browser games under 13kb.
