### Hail, well met ðŸ‘‹

My main work is [Medplum](https://github.com/medplum/medplum), an open source healthcare data platform.  Healthcare tech startups use Medplum to launch quickly, securely, and compliantly.  It's built with TypeScript, Node, Express, and React.  If you're interested in healthcare tech, please feel free to reach out.

My hobby projects are all over the place. Perhaps most notable are my entries in the [js13kgames Competition](https://js13kgames.com/) - an annual competition for browser games under 13kb.
